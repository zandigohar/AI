Abstract: Cancer is one of the most dangerous diseases in the world, and still, many people cannot survive. Further, there still is no cure for cancer stages of 4, hence, early detection of cancer plays a significant role in human survival. When cancer is detected early, treatment is more likely to be successful. Recent researches on machine learning methods and algorithms in cancer diagnosis have shown that ML can help diagnose people with cancer in early stages. Machine learning methods are even used for cancer susceptibly prediction including artificial neural networks (ANNs), support vector machine (SVMs), Bayesian network (BNs), graph-based semi-supervised learning (Graph-based SSL), SSL Co-training algorithm and decision trees (DTs). The mentioned techniques have been used to model the progression and treatment of cancerous cells. ML is able to detect key features from complex datasets and in this project, a comprehensive analysis of those ML techniques will be utilized in order to find the accuracy of each method. A good picture of the link between ML algorithms and breast cancer detection would be outlined, and the significant impact of AI in dangerous disease treatments would be depicted. Each method were ranked and the important features in cancer detection was outlined.

Keywords: Cancer, Breast Cancer, Machine Learning, Supervised Learning.
