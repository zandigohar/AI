Markov and hidden markov models (HMM) are studied here.

Package used: pomegranate. pomegranate is a Python package that implements fast and flexible probabilistic models ranging from individual probability distributions to compositional models such as Bayesian networks and hidden Markov models.

States: Sunny, Rainy, Cloudy

Hidden states: Low pressure, High pressure

Both codes give the probability for an arbitrary sequence of events.
