# AI codes from simple to advanced

Machine Learning Scripts and Reports:

I have uploaded some course projects done with aritificial intelligence (Fall 2019) here, including: Handwritten digit classification, breast cancer prediction, markvo models (MM) and hidden morkov models (HMM).

The codes are all  written in Python 3. 

You may need to install some packages to run the code including 'sklearn' and 'pomegranate'.

Please read the README.md for each of the directories for more details.
